# Examine movie/rating congruence
Each movie displays a specific emotion, however the participant is requested to rate each movie for all the 6 emotions, using a scale from 1 to 10.

Congruence is defined in a very simple way: 

- the subject's rating is congruent if - in each trial - the highest score is given to the emotion which is actually displayed in the movie.

- congruence is therefore here defined as a binary variable.

# Calculate deviations of each subject from the validation data

This should be done with RSA, that is: 
- we take all the 56 x 6 rows of each sub, 
- calculate the distance matrix
- get the tril
- calculate the distance matrix and the tril also for the validation data
- calculate 1 - R between each sub and the validation

First we need to import a few funs
```{r, message=FALSE}
# ----------- DDOS - Do Distance Or Similarity -----------
# The input matrix should be observations-by-variables, that is:
# - rows index observations
# - columns index variables
# This is the format required by dist(), while for cor() is the
# opposite, so when using the cor() function we pass t(X) 

library(proxy)

DDOS <- function(X, method) {
  
  X[is.na(X)] = 0
  
  switch(method,
         pearson = {
           D <- 1 - cor(t(X), method = "pearson") %>% as.dist()
         },
         
         spearman = {
           D <- 1 - cor(t(X), method = "spearman") %>% as.dist()
         },
         
         euclidean = {
           D <- dist(X, method = "euclidean")
         },
         
         cosine = {
           D <- 1 - simil(X, method = "cosine")
         },
         
         mahalanobis = {
           D <- dist(X, method = "mahalanobis")
         },
         stop("Supported methods: 'pearson', 'spearman', 'euclidean', 'cosine' or 'mahalanobis'.")
  )
  return(D)
}

# # example usage:
# DDOS(Y, method = "cosine")




# ------------------- Ratings RDM calculation --------------------

# # Function to calculate the ratings RDM for one sub
# sub_id = "02"
# dist_method_rating <- "euclidean"
# rats <- read_csv(ratings_path)
# ncomp_svd = 3

do_RDM_ratings_one_sub <- function(rats, dist_method_rating) {
  
  rats_one_sub <- rats %>% select(starts_with("r_"))
  
  D_rats <- DDOS(rats_one_sub, method = dist_method_rating)
  D_rats[is.na(D_rats)] <- 0
  
  D_feature_vector <- D_rats[!is.na(D_rats)]

  return(D_feature_vector)
  
}


test_tril <- do_RDM_ratings_one_sub(rune_df,dist_method_rating = "euclidean")


```




**VERY IMPORTANT** to make the comparison correct, we need to have the same order
of movies!! Therefore use group_by(sub) and arrange(video)

```{r}

# first calculate the RDM_validation
# NB: we nest it so that we can have the same df structure of the RDM_subs and 
# easily join them
RDM_validation <- rune_df %>% 
  arrange(video) %>% 
  nest %>% 
  mutate(RDM_validation = map(data, ~ do_RDM_ratings_one_sub(.x, dist_method_rating = "euclidean"))) %>% 
  select(RDM_validation)


# calculate the RDM_subs
RDM_subs <- df %>% 
  group_by(sub) %>% 
  arrange(sub,video) %>% 
  nest %>%
  mutate(RDM_subs = map(data, ~ do_RDM_ratings_one_sub(.x, dist_method_rating = "euclidean"))) %>% 
  select(sub, RDM_subs)
  

# Put them together with a cross_join and finally calculate the similarity of each sub rating
# to the reference estimated by Rune
similarity_sub_rating_reference <- cross_join(RDM_subs,RDM_validation) %>%
  mutate(
    similarity_2_reference = list(RDM_subs, RDM_validation) %>% pmap_dbl(~ cor(.x, .y, method = "pearson"))  
  ) %>% 
  mutate(similarity_2_reference = round(similarity_2_reference, 2)) %>%
  select(!starts_with("RDM")) %>% 
  arrange(desc(similarity_2_reference))

similarity_sub_rating_reference
```


# Relationship between congruence and similarity to the validation set

This is interesting, since it's not trivial the fact that the similarity of each sub to the 
normative rating data is proportional to the congruence. But actually it is!

```{r, message=FALSE}
congruence_and_similarity_to_reference <- inner_join(similarity_sub_rating_reference, df_congruence, by = "sub") 

congruence_and_similarity_to_reference %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ALL, y = similarity_2_reference)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_label(aes(color = ALL, label = sub)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, color = "lightblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Association between congruence and similarity to the reference",
    x = "Congruence between highest rated emotion and video content",
    y = "Similarity of each subject rating to the reference rating"
  ) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "coral")

fit <- lm(ALL ~ similarity_2_reference, data = congruence_and_similarity_to_reference)

jtools::summ(fit)
```


# Plot all ratings for participants above and below a given congruence

This is a great plot because it shows the difference between people with
high and low congruence:

- people with low congruence tend to give > 0 ratings to different emotions
  for each movie
  
- on average the rating for the congruent movie appears to be similar for both
  people above and below congruence, although in some cases it is higher for
  people with high congruence


```{r}

congruence_threshold <- 0.85

# tmp <- df_congruence %>%
#   count(is_congruent = ALL >= congruence_threshold)

n_above <- which(df_congruence$ALL >= congruence_threshold) %>% length
n_below <- length(df_congruence$sub) - n_above

df %>%
  select(sub, starts_with("r_"), emotion) %>% 
  inner_join(df_congruence %>% select(sub, ALL), by = "sub") %>% 
  mutate(is_congruent = ifelse(ALL >= congruence_threshold, "ABOVE", "BELOW")) %>%
  mutate(is_congruent = factor(is_congruent)) %>% 
  select(-ALL) %>% 
  group_by(sub, emotion, is_congruent) %>%
  reframe(
    across(starts_with("r_"), ~ round(mean(.),2))
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("r_"), names_to = "rating_type", values_to = "rating") %>%

  geom_line(linewidth = 0.5, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_point(color = "grey") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 10), breaks = seq(0, 10, by = 2)) +  # Setting y-axis limits and breaks

    title = paste0("Ratings for participants above or below congruence of ", congruence_threshold),
    subtitle = paste0("n_above: ", n_above, " n_below: ", n_below)
  )
  
  


```


# Relation with Arousal and Valence

The correlation between Arousal and Valence - calculated within subjects - ranges from -0.76 to 0. There is no apparent correlation between this and congruence.

```{r, message=FALSE}

df_A <- read_csv(paste0(bd,"/","arousal_ratings.csv")) %>% 
  select(sub,video,r_arousal,emotion)


df_V <- read_csv(paste0(bd,"/","valence_ratings.csv")) %>% 
  select(sub,video,r_valence)
  

df_AV <- inner_join(df_A, df_V, by = c("sub","video")) %>% 
  select(sub, r_arousal, r_valence, emotion)

ff <- df_AV %>% 
  select(sub, r_arousal, r_valence) %>% 
  group_by(sub) %>% 
  nest %>% 
  mutate(cor_AV = map_dbl(data, ~ cor(.x$r_arousal, .x$r_valence, method = "spearman"))) %>% 
  arrange(cor_AV) %>% 
  inner_join(
    df_congruence %>% select(sub, ALL) %>% rename(congruence = ALL), 
    by = "sub"
  )


ff %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = congruence, y = cor_AV)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal()


```


# RSA _between models_
We find that the similarity is highly positive (0.4..0.6) and highly negative (-0.4..-0.6) in the **same locations** for arousal and emotion respectively.

Is this a (mere) reflection that the two models are negatively correlated to each other? The simple analysis below shows that it is not the case.

This opens the possibility that _different parts of the varibility in the fmri RDM are explained by emotion and arousal RDM_. If correct, this would be extremely interesting and valuable.
