# RSA ROI Explorer

V 6.2
- idx_ROI : fixed the issue when (ROI number != RSA_mean row number), i.e. when not all ROIs values are present in the atlas (e.g. because some have been masked out)
- idx_ROI_value_in_atlas : same as above but for atlas display

V 3
- include ttest of [model] !=0 
- select roi from reactable
- change color palette to viridis family (inferno)
- hidden controls for Papaya
